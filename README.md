# Cucumber-Automation-using-POM
This a page object wrapper on cucumber which uses Selenium WebDriver.

Now in this framework i am extracting test data using Sample Keyword.
Also shown one more option by adding test data spreadsheet from reading from xls.

*For Google page i was unable to click on the elements which is on 3rd top link because DOM structure is keep on changing
with tagName <a> by href and getting those list of all elements if we do .getIndex(3) bit difficult in it. I have faced these challenges.*
